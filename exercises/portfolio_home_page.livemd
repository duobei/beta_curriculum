## Home Page

You're going to create a portfolio project that you will continue to expand throughout the course.

In this exercise, you'll focus on setting up the project and creating a home page.

First, create a new Phoenix project.

```
$ mix phx.new portfolio
```

Start your Phoenix server from the project folder.

```
$ mix phx.server
```

Then build a home page under the `"/"` route.

You may take inspiration from the previous [Home Page](./home_page.livemd) exercise.

![](images/portfolio_home_page_exercise.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The home page should be visible when you visit http://localhost:4000/

Try to match the document above as best you can, however you may exercise your creativity and do not have to follow the example so long as you have:

* Navigation with a link to your github. Ideally use a `<nav>` tag for navigation.
* A heading saying your name.
* A paragraph that describes who you are and what you do.
* An image (it can be any image if you would prefer to not use a personal photo)

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the project folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish portfolio home page exercise"
```
